/*Optimum location of point to minimize total distance
Given a set of points as and a line as ax+by+c = 0. We need to find a point on given line for
which sum of distances from given set of points is minimum.

If we take one point on given line at infinite distance then total distance cost will be
infinite, now when we move this point on line towards given points the total distance cost
starts decreasing and after some time, it again starts increasing which reached to infinite on
the other infinite end of line so distance cost curve looks like a U-curve and we have to find
the bottom value of this U-curve.
As U-curve is not monotonically increasing or decreasing we canâ€™t use binary search for finding
bottom most point, here we will use ternary search for finding bottom most point, ternary
search skips one third of search space at each iteration.
