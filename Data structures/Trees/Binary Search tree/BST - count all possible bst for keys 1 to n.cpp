/*How many structurally unique BSTs for keys from 1..N?

For example, for N = 2, there are 2 unique BSTs
     1               2  
      \            /
       2         1 

For N = 3, there are 5 possible BSTs
  1              3        3         2      1
    \           /        /        /  \      \
     3        2         1        1    3      2
    /       /            \                    \
   2      1               2                    3

We know that all node in left subtree are smaller than root and in right subtree are larger than root so if we have ith number as root, all numbers 
from 1 to i-1 will be in left subtree and i+1 to N will be in right subtree. If 1 to i-1 can form x different trees and i+1 to N can from y different trees 
then we will have x*y total trees when ith number is root and we also have N choices for root also so we can simply iterate from 1 to N for root and another 
loop for left and right subtree. If we take a closer look, we can notice that the count is basically nâ€™th Catalan number.*/

/*How to construct all BST for keys 1..N?
The idea is to maintain a list of roots of all BSTs. Recursively construct all possible left and right subtrees. Create a tree for every pair of left and right 
subtree and add the tree to list. */
