/*Connect nodes at same level using constant extra space
Write a function to connect all the adjacent nodes at the same level in a binary tree. Structure of the given Binary Tree node is like following.

struct node {
  int data;
  struct node* left;
  struct node* right;
  struct node* nextRight;
}
Run on IDE
Initially, all the nextRight pointers point to garbage values. Your function should set these pointers to point next right for each node. 
You can use only constant extra space.

Example

Input Tree
       A
      / \
     B   C
    / \   \
   D   E   F

Output Tree
       A--->NULL
      / \
     B-->C-->NULL
    / \   \
   D-->E-->F-->NULL
We discussed two different approaches to do it in the previous post. The auxiliary space required in both of 
those approaches is not constant. Also, the method 2 discussed there only works for complete Binary Tree.

In this post, we will first modify the method 2 to make it work for all kind of trees. After that, we will 
remove recursion from this method so that the extra space becomes constant.

A Recursive Solution
In the method 2 of previous post, we traversed the nodes in pre order fashion. Instead of traversing in 
Pre Order fashion (root, left, right), if we traverse the nextRight node before the left and right children 
(root, nextRight, left), then we can make sure that all nodes at level i have the nextRight set, before the 
level i+1 nodes. Let us consider the following example (same example as previous post). The method 2 fails 
for right child of node 4. In this method, we make sure that all nodes at the 4â€™s level (level 2) have nextRight set, 
before we try to set the nextRight of 9. So when we set the nextRight of 9, we search for a nonleaf node on 
right side of node 4 (getNextRight() does this for us).
