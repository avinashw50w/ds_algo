1. If we want to delete a node from the list:
--delete the first node: Node *curr = *head; 
						*head = (*head)->next;
						delete curr;

-- delete an inner node, always take a *prev and do 
 	if the node is found: prev->next = curr->next
 	else prev = curr;
 	curr = curr->next

2. while iterating through the list dont forget to increment the curr (curr = curr->next)

3. if the function is going to change the head, then pass the pointer to the head to the function 
	call: fun(&head);
	definition: void fun(Node **head) {}
