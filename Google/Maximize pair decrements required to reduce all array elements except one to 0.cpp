/*Maximize pair decrements required to reduce all array elements except one to 0
Given an array arr[] consisting of N distinct elements, the task is to find the maximum number 
of pairs required to be decreased by 1 in each step, such that N â€“ 1 array elements are reduced 
to 0 and the remaining array element is a non-negative integer.*/
