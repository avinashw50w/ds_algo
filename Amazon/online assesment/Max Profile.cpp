An Amazon seller is deciding which of their products to invest in for the next quarter to maximize their profits.
They have each of their products listed as segments of a circle. Due to varying market conditions, 
the products do not sell consistently. The seller wants to achieve maximum profit using limited resources for investment. 
The product list is segmented into a number of equal segments, and a projected profit is calculated for each segment. 
The projected profit is the cost to invest versus the sale price of the product. 
The seller has chosen to invest in a number of contiguous segments along with those opposite. 
Determine the maximum profit the seller can achieve using this approach.

For example, the product list Is divided into n = 6 sections and will select k = 2 contiguous sections and those 
opposite to invest in. The profit estimates are profit = [1, 5, 1, 3, 7, -3] respectively. 
The diagrams below show the possible choices with profits[0] at the 9 oâ€™clock position and filling counterclockwise.
