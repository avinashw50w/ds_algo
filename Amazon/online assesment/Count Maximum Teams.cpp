/*
Amazon is hosting a team hackathon.
- Each team will have exactly teamSize developers.
- A developerâ€™s skill level is denoted by skill[i].
- The difference between the maximum and minimum skill levels within a team cannot exceed a threshold, maxDiff.
- Determine the maximum number of teams that can be formed from the contestants.

eg.
skill = [3, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5]
team5ize = 3
maxDiff = 2

At most, 2 teams can be formed: [3, 3, 1] and [4, 6, 5].

			teams++;
			i = j + 1;
			j += teamSize;
		} else {
