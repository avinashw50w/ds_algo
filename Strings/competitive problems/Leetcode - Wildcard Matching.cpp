/*Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'.

'?' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Note:

s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like ? or *.
Example 1:

Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
Example 2:

Input:
s = "aa"
p = "*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.

Analysis:
For each element in s
If *s==*p or *p == ? which means this is a match, then goes to next element s++ p++.
If p=='*', this is also a match, but one or many chars may be available, so let us save this *'s position and the matched s position.
If not match, then we check if there is a * previously showed up,
       if there is no *,  return false;
       if there is an *,  we set current p to the next element of *, and set current s to the next saved s position.

e.g.
abed
?b*d**

a=?, go on, b=b, go on,
e=*, save * position star=3, save s position ss = 3, p++
e!=d,  check if there was a *, yes, ss++, s=ss; p=star+1
d=d, go on, meet the end.
check the rest element in p, if all are *, true, else false;*/

bool isMatch(char * s, char * p){
    char *star = NULL;
    char *ss = s;
    
    while (*s) {
        if ((*s == *p) || (*p == '?')) { s++; p++; continue; }
        if (*p == '*') { star = p++; ss = s; continue; }
        if (star) { p = star+1; s = ++ss; continue; }
        return false;
    }
    
    while (*p == '*') p++;
    
    return !*p;
}
