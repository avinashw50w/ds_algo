/*Friends Pairing Problem
Given n friends, each one can remain single or can be paired up with some other friend. Each friend can be paired only once. Find out the total number of ways in which friends can remain single or can be paired up.

Examples :

Input  : n = 3
Output : 4

Explanation
{1}, {2}, {3} : all single
{1}, {2,3} : 2 and 3 paired but 1 is single.
{1,2}, {3} : 1 and 2 are paired but 3 is single.
{1,3}, {2} : 1 and 3 are paired but 2 is single.
Note that {1,2} and {2,1} are considered same.*/

/*f(n) = ways n people can remain single 
       or pair up.

For n-th person there are two choices:
1) n-th person remains single, we recur 
   for f(n - 1)
2) n-th person pairs up with any of the 
   remaining n - 1 persons. We get (n - 1) * f(n - 2)

Therefore we can recursively write f(n) as:
f(n) = f(n - 1) + (n - 1) * f(n - 2)*/


int solve(int n) {
    int d[n+1];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i <= 2) dp[i] = i;
        else 
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (n-1) * dp[i-2];
    }

    return dp[n];
