# Problem

Write a script that reads an input file line by line and sums each column in the file.

The script outputs the total sum for each column after the file has been read.

If a line doesn't have a valid numeric value in a given field, treat that occurrence as the number 0.

Lines do not necessarily have the same number of columns. Missing columns are assumed to have the value 0, just as if there was an invalid numeric value.
