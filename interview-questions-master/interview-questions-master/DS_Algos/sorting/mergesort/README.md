# mergesort

Best case: O(n log(n))

Worst case: O(n log(n))

Average case: O(n log(n))

Memory: O(n)

Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It breaks an array in 2 halves, recursively sorts those 2 halves separately, and then merges them. It's efficient when compared to other simple sorting algorithms, because it guarantees O(n log(n)) worst case performance, but it has the disadvantage of using O(n) memory. However, **mergesort is easily applied to lists**, since it only requires sequential access rather than random access, which is wonderful.
