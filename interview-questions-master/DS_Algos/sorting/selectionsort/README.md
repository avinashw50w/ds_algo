Selection sort is the child's sorting algorithm: look at every element, find the minimum, and swap it with the first element. Repeat this with the rest of the elements. It's a pretty naive sorting algorithm. However, selection sort has the advantage that it performs exactly `n` swaps. This might be good if swapping elements is very expensive.
