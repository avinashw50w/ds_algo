# bubblesort

Best case: O(n)

Worst case: O(n^2)

Average case: O(n^2)

Memory: O(1)

Bubblesort works by comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if the left side is greater than the right side. This keeps happening until the array is fully sorted. It can be used to sort small sets. It works relatively well, perhaps even better than other fancier sorting techniques, when the input data is likely to be almost sorted, or already sorted. In such a scenario, the algorithm makes O(n) swaps, beating other common and more efficient algorithms.
