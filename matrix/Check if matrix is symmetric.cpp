/*A square matrix is said to be symmetric matrix if the transpose of the matrix is same as
 the given matrix. Symmetric matrix can be obtain by changing row to column and column
 to row.

Examples:

Input : 1 2 3
        2 1 4
        3 4 3
Output : Yes

IDEA:
1. create transpose of the matrix
2. check if it's equal to the original one
