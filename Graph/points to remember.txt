1. Depth First Traversal can be used to detect cycle in both directed and undirected Graph.
2. cycle in an undirected graph can also be found using disjoint sets
3. DFS for a connected graph produces a tree.
4. Dijkstra is BFS with priority queue. It is a greedy algorithm, coz we choose the neighbor with
    the shortest weight.

Shortest paths
1. From a given source node:
    - For Unweighted graphs, use BFS to find the shortest path. Distance array can be used as visited 
    array coz if a node is visited for the first time, then it's distance from src is minimum.
    - DFS can also be used, but it is inefficient way.

    - For weighted graph, use Dijkstra if every edge weights >= 0, otherwise use Bellman Ford
