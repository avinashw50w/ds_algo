/*A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex) iff removing it (and edges through it) 
disconnects the graph. Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a connected network â€“ single points whose failure 
would split the network into 2 or more disconnected components. They are useful for designing reliable networks.
For a disconnected undirected graph, an articulation point is a vertex removing which increases number of connected components.
A O(V+E) algorithm to find all Articulation Points (APs)
The idea is to use DFS (Depth First Search). In DFS, we follow vertices in tree 
form called DFS tree. In DFS tree, a vertex u is parent 
of another vertex v, if v is discovered by u (obviously v is an adjacent of u in graph). 
In DFS tree, a vertex u is articulation point 
if one of the following two conditions is true.
1) u is root of DFS tree and it has at least two children.
2) u is not root of DFS tree and it has a child v such that no vertex in subtree 
rooted with v has a back edge to one of the ancestors (in DFS tree) of u.*/
